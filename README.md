# Atestat_Pascal2048

This is a project I did for my Atestat exam at the end of 12th grade, please take that into consideration when reviewing it.
It is a 2048 game written using the Pascal programming language.
The full documentation, written at the time in romanian, can be found in [2048docum.odt](https://github.com/bloopeti/Atestat_Pascal2048/blob/master/2048docum.odt).
Run the application by executing [project2048.exe](https://github.com/bloopeti/Atestat_Pascal2048/blob/master/project2048.exe).
The final code can be found in [project2048.pas](https://github.com/bloopeti/Atestat_Pascal2048/blob/master/project2048.pas), there is code in the folders of the repo, but those are just the progress to the final version.
